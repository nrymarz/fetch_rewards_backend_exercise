## Starting the Server
Run 'bundle install' to install the dependencies before running the server. To start the rails server run 'rails s' in the console.

## Testing the backend with the SPA
To test the backend I made a Singe Page Application which has forms for adding new transactions and spending points. To use the page for testing make sure to run the server and open 'index.html' located in the root directory of this application. You can open the console for viewing the responses after submitting the forms. The SPA uses JS for submitting forms without reloading.
